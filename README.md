# PrepareStageCompactor

This plugin replaces the sidebar with a more compact variation of the original sidebar:

* Nozzle & material dropdowns are combined to a single line
* "Check compatibility" link is removed
* Extruder selection buttons are downsized
* Custom/recommended buttons are moved to a combobox at the top
* Margins are tweaked

Note: because this plugin replaces the sidebar with a patched version it is important that you install the version of this plugin that matches the version of Cura.
